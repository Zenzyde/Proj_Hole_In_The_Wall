# Proj_Hole_In_The_Wall
This project was to play around with and get experience making a local multiplayer game. I've seen a "hole in the wall" game show which looked fun, so i wanted to replicate it as a local 2-player game.

This little game uses a 2-player split-screen format, where player 1 is on the upper camera and player 2 on the lower camera. Player 1 moves using WASD and Spacebar. Player 2 moves using Arrowkeys and Right Ctrl.

To leave off, here's a little visual of the game in action, for your viewing pleasure!
